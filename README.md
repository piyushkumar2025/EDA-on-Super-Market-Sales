# EDA-on-Super-Market-Sales
In my EDA of the Superstore_USA dataset, I cleaned the data and analyzed profit, customer segments, and sales trends. I identified opportunities to boost profit through better pricing strategies, cost management, and targeted customer segments. Insights from sales patterns and customer behavior will help refine strategies to increase profitability.
